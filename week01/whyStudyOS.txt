Why we have to study Operating System?

The backbone of network infrastructure, the base of internet is a hardware piece, which we technically call as a Server. Server is in some ways similar to CPU in terms of functionality.

A high performance CPU with high technical and hardware specs can be called as a Server. So what does a CPU run to do tasks or to implement instructions?

It runs a Operating System. The whole world today depends on internet. Everything which you see and follow directly or indirectly depends on Internet. Now, Server is a backbone of the Internet Community. Every instruction is implemented by a Server which runs some sort of Operating System.

To make this world better or to influence the world of Internet, you should definitely know about a Operating System. It's the base of everything.
